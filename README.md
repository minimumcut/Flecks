## What is this?
This is an nearly-pure WebGL implementation of Voronoi Stippling as described in [this](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2002/secord2002b/secord.2002b.pdf) paper.
Most of the core algorithm could be done in WebGL which makes this very fast compared to similar implementations.

## What does this do?
This is an artistic photo filter.  By inputting an image it will output a [stippled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stippling) version.

## Usage

Github pages is coming soon.
## Images

## System Requirements

Your graphics card and browser must support WebGL 1.0 and the EXT_color_buffer_float extension.  The lastest versions of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera and Google Ultron support WebGL 2.0.
